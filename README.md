# Open-Source Data System for *Pacific Salmon Environmental Covariates* (PSEC)

## Purpose

Population models for Pacific salmon (*Oncorhynchus* spp.) increasingly consider environmental covariates to improve forecasts or develop estimates of management reference points that respond to changing conditions. These analyses generally draw on the same suite of environmental covariates, but with potentially significant differences in the data treatment details. Some of the widely used series are publicly available (e.g. Pacific Decadal Oscillation index), and for some of the common covariates raw source data is published online (e.g., sea surface temperature records from British Columbia lighthouses). Specific data sets used in published analyses are increasingly published via github repositories or as supplementary files to the papers, but these are not routinely updated with new records.

However, until recently there has been no centralized public source of directly usable environmental covariate series to support routine exploration and testing of hypotheses. To address this gap, we are building an open-source data system using existing GitHub functionality. 

[**Pacific Salmon Environmental Covariates (PSEC)**](https://github.com/SOLV-Code/Open-Source-Env-Cov-PacSalmon) focuses on building a data set and comprehensive context through collaborative development in a human-centered framework that minimizes technical obstacles for contributors. The open-source collaborative approach has great potential, but *PSEC* has also encountered considerable challenges in the initial development phase.
